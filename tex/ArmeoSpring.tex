\outline{2}{Introduction}
\section{Introduction}
Stoke is one of the leading cause of death and disability globally today (Benjamin et al., 2017).
Movement impairment due to stroke affects quality of life of stroke survivors (cite).
Stroke survivors usually display atypical movement patterns, referred to as abnormal “synergies” (Brunnström, 1970). 
It is not clear how abnormal synergies interact with the recovery of function. 
On the one hand, abnormal joint coordination may serve as compensation mechanism for functional daily use (Levin, Kleim,  Wolf, 2009); 
on the other hand, it is not clear how this compensation mechanisms helps or hinders recovery. 
To improve rehabilitation effectiveness, a better understanding of how joint coordination patterns affect recovery of functional abilities is required.
 
The challenging of stroke rehabilitation also stems from a character of high variability in lesion, impairment, spontaneous recovery, and responsiveness to therapy (Cramer, 2008a, 2008b). 
It is therefore crucial to recognize individual differences and identify key factors that play important role for recovery.
 
Due to the redundant nature of upper extremity kinematics, healthy individuals exploit redundancy (Kutch  Valero-Cuevas, 2011) or control the task relevant part of the redundancy to achieve a certain task (Scholz  Schöner, 1999). 
(Singh, Jana, Ghosal,  Murthy, 2016) shows that redundancy in joint space is exploited by healthy individuals to facilitate learning. 
For individuals post-stroke however, it is unclear what roles redundancy might play in motor learning and recovery.
 
In this study, we investigate the effect of abnormal synergy patterns and redundancy exploitation on motor learning and recovery. 
We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to quantify joint synergies (van Kordelaar, van Wegen,  Kwakkel, 2012) and measure similarities between synergies with principle angles between subspaces (Björck  Golub, 1973). 
We adapt the method in (Singh et al., 2016) to estimate redundancy exploitation.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data Collection}

\textbf{Participants.} 
We recruited 11 young (age 23 $\pm$ 2) healthy subjects (7 males) as the control group.
We recruited 53 post-stroke individuals with gender and affected side balanced, shown in table \ref{tab:demog}. 
Participants receive conventional rehabilitation besides robot-aided rehabilitation.

\begin{table}[b]
	\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c}
		\hline
		Group & No. & Age & Affected Side & Gender & FM(0-66) & Post Stroke Days & No. of Tests\\

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Participants information}
	\label{tab:demog}
\end{table}

\textbf{Device.}
Our robot-aided rehabilitation uses Armeo@Spring exoskeleton from Hocoma\footnote{https://www.hocoma.com/us/} for therapy training. 
Shown in figure \ref{fig:1setupschedule}, the exoskeleton has 6 degrees of freedom, summarized in table \ref{tab:devicedof} and Fig. \ref{fig:1setupschedule}B. 
It is attached to the arm by two or three velcro straps. 
The exoskeleton has two springs equipped, at the upper arm and the forearm respectively. 
The springs can be adjusted to compensate the gravity force of the arm. 
Lengths of the exoskeleton are also adjustable to adapt to user's arm length.
There are no motors at any joints; user has to move actively to control the exoskeleton. 
User's trunk is mildly constrained by the velcro strap at the upper arm.


\begin{table}
	\begin{tabular}{c c c c}
		\hline
		Joint No. & Joint Name & Anatomical Counterpart & Direction \\
		\hline
		1(a) & Inner Shoulder Angle & Shoulder Horizontal Ab-/Adduction & Left/Right \\
		1(b) & Outer Shoulder Angle & Shoulder Horizontal Ab-/Adduction & Left/Right \\
		2 & Upper Arm Angle & Shoulder Flex-/Extension & Up/Down \\
		3 & Elbow Angle & - & Left/Right \\
		4 & Forearm Angle & - & Up/Down \\
		5 & Pro-/Supination Angle & Pro-/Supination & - \\ 
		6 & Flex-/Extension Angle & Wrist Flex-/Extension & - \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Degrees of freedom of ArmeoSpring exoskeleton.}
	\label{tab:devicedof}
\end{table}

The device records all joint angles (that is, the joints of the exoskeleton), and calculates the end effector location through a forward kinematics model of the exoskeleton. 
The end effector location then is used to control a cursor on a screen, displayed vertically in front of the user. 
All joint angles and end effector locations are recorded.

\textbf{Training and Test.}
Participants in the control group receive two training sessions (morning and afternoon) for five consecutive days in a week.
Post-stroke participants receive the same amount of training per day every weekday for four consecutive weeks (Fig. \ref{fig:1setupschedule}C).

One training session consists of several games; each lasts at most 3 minutes (with the exception of the ladybug pointing test mentioned below).
One training session typically lasts about 20 minutes.

A ladybug-pointing test is scheduled at the beginning and the end of each training session. 
This test is two-dimensional; the movement along the dimension perpendicular to the screen is ignored. 
In this test, the user tries to catch ladybugs that appear one by one pseudo randomly on the screen. 
The sequence of locations that ladybugs appear is fixed, although within a test they seem random.
To catch the ladybug, the user moves the cursor to its location. 
The user has limited time to catch the ladybug.
After a ladybug is caught, or the time limit is reached, the ladybug disappears and the next ladybug appears somewhere else.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Analysis}

\textbf{Preprocessing.}
We filter the data with a second order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 5 Hz.
We define a trial as the movement between two consecutive ladybugs.
A trial is considered successful if it starts from previously caught target and leads to the catching of next target. 
Only successful trials (control 99.8\%, stroke 78.2\%) are included in task space performance analysis.
We also exclude tests in which participants caught less than 25\% ladybugs (that is 0.7\% of all tests).

\textbf{Task Space Performance.}
We characterize task space performance of a ladybug test via the average number of peaks in the velocity profile \cite{}. 
To calculate the number of peaks in a velocity profile of a trial, we take the derivative of velocity (tangential acceleration) and count the number of times it goes from positive to negative.
We then take the average of number of peaks ($ p $) of all successful trials in the test.

We model the dynamics of number of peaks $ p $ as exponential functions of time $ t $ represented by task number, with mixed effects.
For participants in the control group, we consider a single exponential formulation
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:singleexp}
p_{i,j} = A_i \exp(-B_i t_{j}) + 1 + \epsilon_{i,j}
\end{equation}
where $ t_{j} = j $ is the test number $ j $, 
$ A_i $ is the mixed-effect coefficient representing the amplitude of the exponential for participant $ i $,
$ B_i $ is the mixed-effect coefficient representing the learning rate,
and $ \epsilon_{i,j} $ is the residual. 
We choose an asymptote of 1 because it is the theoretical limit of number of peaks.

For participants in the stroke group, we consider two exponential components to formulate the number of peaks
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:doubleexp}
p_{i,j} = A^f_{i,j} \exp(-B^f_{i,j} t_j) + A^s_{i,j} \exp(-B^s_{i,j} t_j) + 1 + \epsilon_{i,j}
\end{equation}
where $ A^f, A^s, B^f $ and $ B^s $ are constraint to be positive, and $ B^f > B^s $, therefore the first term represents a fast component, the second a slow component.

Mixed effect model coefficients are estimated via Matlab 2016a function \textsf{nlmefit}.

\textbf{Conversion of Joint Angles}
The recordings from ARMEO Spring are joint angles of the exoskeleton, different from anatomical joint angles.
It is therefore important to infer anatomical joint angles from exoskeleton joint angles. 

\textbf{Joint Space Variability.}
Because the last two joints (pronation/supination and wrist angle) have relatively small variance (control 12.4\%, stroke 4.6\%), we ignore them during joint space variability analysis and synergy analysis.
To quantify joint space variability and its relevance to the task space, we use a nonlinear forward kinematics model of the exoskeleton (cite company \cite{})
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:nonlinearForwardKinematics}
	\bm{r} = f(\bm{\theta})
	\end{equation}
where $ \bm{r} = (x,y)^T $ is the location of the end effector, $ \bm{\theta} $ is joint angles (see Table \ref{tab:devicedof} and Fig. \ref{fig:1setupschedule}B for details). 
The distribution of variability for each target(ladybug) is calculated from the last 10 tests at the moment of catching the ladybug. 

The mean joint configuration across the last 10 tests at one specific ladybug ($ b $) is denoted by $ \bar{\bm{\theta}}_b $.
We will omit index $ b $ for convenience.
The Jacobian matrix at configuration $ \bar{\bm{\theta}} $ is obtained through forward kinematics (Eqn. \ref{eqn:nonlinearForwardKinematics})
	\begin{equation}
	\bm{J}(\bar{\bm{\theta}}) = \frac{\partial f(\bm{\theta})}{\partial \bm{\theta}} \Big\rvert_{\bar{\bm{\theta}}}
	\end{equation}
which is a 2 by 4 matrix.
The null space of Jacobian $ \bm{J} $ can be represented by basis of the space $ \bm{\xi}_i $, $ i= 1,2 $ which satisfy
	\begin{equation}
	\bm{J}(\bar{\bm{\theta}}) \bm{\xi}_i = 0
	\end{equation}
This means that movements in the null space ($ \bm{\xi}_i $) have no effect on the location of end effector, hence is task irrelevant.
Therefore we also call the null space as the task-irrelevant space.
For a specific test ($ t $) , the deviation of joint angles from $ \bar{\bm{\theta}} $ is
	\begin{equation}
	\Delta\bm{\theta}_t = \bm{\theta}_t - \bar{\bm{\theta}}
	\end{equation}
We will omit index $ t $ as well.
The projection of $ \Delta\bm{\theta} $ to the task-irrelevant space is
	\begin{equation}
	\Delta\bm{\theta}_{\text{null}} = \sum_i^m \langle \Delta\bm{\theta}, \bm{\xi}_i \rangle \bm{\xi}_i, m=2
	\end{equation}
where $ \langle,\rangle $ represents inner product.
In the end, we quantify the task-irrelevant variability by calculating the mean of squared $ \Delta\bm{\theta}_{\text{null}} $
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:nullvar}
	V_{\text{null}}(t,b) = \mathbb{E}_{t,b} (\Delta\bm{\theta}_{\text{null}}^T\Delta\bm{\theta}_{\text{null}})
	\end{equation}
where $ t,b $ index tests and targets (ladybugs). 
We then average $ V_{\text{null}}(t,b) $ across tests ($ t $) and targets ($ b $) as the measure of task-irrelevant variability of a participant. 
Because $ V_{\text{null}} $ is similar to the calculation of variance, it has unit of $ \text{deg}^2 $.
It is on average the summation of variance across all joints.

To obtain variability in the orthogonal (task-relevant) space, we simply replace $ \bm{\xi}_i $ with the basis of the orthogonal space, $ \bm{\psi}_i $, $ i= 1,2 $  :
	\begin{equation}
	\Delta\bm{\theta}_{\text{orth}} = \sum_i^m \langle \Delta\bm{\theta}, \bm{\psi}_i \rangle \bm{\psi}_i, m=2
	\end{equation}
and the task-relevant space variability is
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:taskvar}
	V_{\text{orth}}(t,b) = \mathbb{E}_{t,b} (\Delta\bm{\theta}_{\text{orth}}^T\Delta\bm{\theta}_{\text{orth}})
	\end{equation}

\textbf{Synergy Extraction and Analysis.}
We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract joint synergies from each ladybug test.
PCA belongs to a family of Dimension Reduction methods.
Principal Components of joint angles, which captures most of the variance presented in the data, can be interpreted as joint synergies \cite{}.
In this study, we only look at the first two synergies which on average account for 83.9\% joint angle variance for control group, 83.1\% for stroke group.
Joint synergies of healthy participants are quite stable across individuals.
We calculate the averaged synergies shown in figure \ref{fig:6synergy}C.

To evaluate the synergy pattern of stroke participant, we use the principal angle \cite{} between subspaces that are spanned by synergies \cite{}.
Generally, the principal angle $ \phi $ between two subspaces is the minimum rotation angle required to rotate one subspace onto the other.
A principal angle of \ang{0} indicates the same synergy patterns, whereas \ang{90} indicates completely different ones.
Therefore we refer to this angle as synergy abnormality.
We use Matlab 2016a \textsf{subspace} \cite{} to calculate the principal angle. 

For each stroke participant, we investigate the synergy abnormality (principal angle) $ \phi $ between his synergies from every test and the average healthy synergies.
$ \phi(t) $ ($ t $ for test) reflects the abnormality of participant's joint synergy patterns throughout training. 
We fit a linear mixed effect model to $ \phi(t) $ with a fixed effect on the intercept $ \phi(0) $ and a random effect on both the intercept and slope (we do not include a fixed effect on the slope because it is not significant when included in the model).
%The intercept $ \phi(0) $ tells us how different this participant's synergy pattern is initially different from the control group.
%It is therefore a measure of joint coordination prior training.

To investigate how joint synergies affects task space learning, we correlate $ \phi(0) $ with task space (fast and slow) learning rate.

\textbf{Linear Regression}
In this study, when doing linear regression, we identify outliers through Cook's Distance (Cook, 1977).
Instead of removing them, we adopt robust regression method with the bisquare weight function (Hoaglin, Mosteller, 1983).

\outline{2}{Results}
\section{Results}

Stroke participants show significant changes after training in kinematics performance.
Fig. \ref{fig:2stroketrajexamp} shows representative trajectories in both task space and joint space. 
After training, the trajectories in task space are straighter, and the joint trajectories also seem smoother. 
%In this particular trial in Fig. \ref{fig:2stroketrajexamp}B, the movement time is also shorter.

\end{figure}

\textbf{Task Space Performance.}
Fig. \ref{fig:3nopfixran} shows the number of peaks modeled by exponential functions.
Control subjects show much fewer number of peaks on average (Fig. \ref{fig:3nopfixran}A).
Stroke participants show significant improvement (Fig. \ref{fig:3nopfixran}B), although still more than control group at the end of training.

	}
	\label{fig:3nopfixran}
\end{figure}


The double exponential mixed effect model (Eqn. \ref{eqn:doubleexp}) gives two learning rates $ b_1 $ and $ b_2 $. 
We refer the smaller of the two, $ b_2 $ as the slow learning rate, the bigger, $ b_1 $ the fast learning rate.
Fig. \ref{fig:3nopfixran}C shows examples of individual fitting.
The slow component, due to small learning rate, is essentially linear; but the fast component usually goes to asymptote during the training.

To interpret these two fitted learning rates, we compare them with Fugul Meyer (FM) assessment score \cite{}.
The post training number of peaks and post training FM are significantly correlated ($ p = 0.0003 $, Fig. \ref{fig:4slowcomponentisrecovery}A).
This indicates that the number of peaks is a good measurement of abnormal synergy patterns.
In addition, the change of number of peaks before and after training due to the slow process (term $ a_2e^{-b_2t} $ in Eqn. \ref{eqn:doubleexp}), correlates significantly ($ p<0.0001 $) with the change of FM (Fig. \ref{fig:4slowcomponentisrecovery}B).
This further indicates that the slow learning process, rather than the fast one, reflects a recovery of synergy patterns.
We therefore refer to $ b_2 $ as the recovery rate, and $ b_1 $ as the learning rate.

	}
	\label{fig:4slowcomponentisrecovery}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Joint Space Variability.}
Both control group and stroke group display much larger task-irrelevant variability than task-relevant variability.
For example, for the control group, the task-irrelevant variability on average is $ \ang{18.3} \pm \ang{19.4} $ (measured by standard deviation, $ \sqrt{V_\text{null}} $); whereas the task-relevant variability ($ \sqrt{V_\text{orth}} $) on average is $ \ang{3.1} \pm \ang{2.9} $.

Task-irrelevant variability positively correlates with the learning rate $ b_1 $ (see Eqn. \ref{eqn:doubleexp}), as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:5learnratevsnullvar}.
Participants with small task-irrelevant variability learn slower (such as SB 46, see Fig. \ref{fig:3nopfixran}C: SB 46);
participants with large tasl-irrelevant variability learn faster (such as SB 46, see Fig. \ref{fig:3nopfixran}C: SB 53);

	\label{fig:5learnratevsnullvar}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Synergy Analysis.}
We identify two synergies from control group, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:6synergy}C.
The first synergy is composed of Shoulder Horizontal (SH) rotation and Elbow (EL) angle, and it is responsible for horizontal movements.
The second synergy is composed of Shoulder Elevation (SE) angle and Forearm (FA) angle, and it is responsible for vertical movements.

We are not able to identify stable synergies from stroke participants due to large differences across different participants.
They can share a similar structure as the control group (Fig. \ref{fig:6synergy}B), or have different structure (Fig. \ref{fig:6synergy}A).

The initial synergy abnormality correlates with the recovery rate $ b_2 $ (see Eqn. \ref{eqn:doubleexp}) as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:6synergy}D.
Participants with large abnormality recovers slower (such as SB 43, see Fig.\ref{fig:3nopfixran}C); while participants with small abnormality recovers faster (such as SB 7, see Fig.\ref{fig:3nopfixran}C).

\outline{2}{Discussion}
\section{Discussion}
We characterize kinematics performance with a double exponential model of number of peaks, and show evidence that the two components link to motor learning and recovery respectively. 
The mixed effect estimation of parameters allow us to obtain estimations of individual learning rates.

Task-irrelevant variability, or variance in the UnControlled Manifold (UCM), is a source of variability that doesn’t affect the execution of a task, which can be represented by variables. 
In the original study, (Scholz  Schöner, 1999) demonstrated that during a functional task, certain relevant variables are not controlled.
The redundancy of human arm kinematics dictates that there must be task-irrelevant variability (the variability that does not affect endpoint trajectories) in the joint space. 
We measure this task-irrelevant variability with adapted method from (Singh et al., 2016). 
Although this variability is task irrelevant, it is not unnecessary since it brings flexibility and allow versatile joint coordination for some specific task. 
However, how task-irrelevant variability affects learning (in healthy subjects) or recovery (in stroke survivors) is a question worth investigating. 
(Singh et al., 2016) suggested that this variability, as a form of redundancy exploitation, helps motor adaptation and learning. 
In our study, we found a correlation between task-irrelevant variability and learning rate of post-stroke individuals, suggesting that it also helps stroke individuals to learn a novel task.

Joint synergies are extracted through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
As a dimension reduction method, PCA provides components that explain the most variability in joint angle space. 
Along with other dimension reduction methods, PCA has been used to extract joint synergies (van Kordelaar et al., 2012). 
Similarities between synergies can be measured through the angle between two synergies in joint angle space, and similarities between groups of synergies can be measured through the angle between two subspaces (Bockemhl, 2010). 
We couldn’t verify the method used in (Bockemhl, 2010), instead we use numerical method in (Björck  Golub, 1973) to calculate angles between subspaces. 
A correlation between joint synergy abnormality and recovery rate may suggest that joint coordination patterns are important for functional recovery.
